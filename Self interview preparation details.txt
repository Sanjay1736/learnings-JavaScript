Tips on how to answer the question:
Start with confidence. Do not stammer or sound nervous. This will only be possible if you have prepared pointers for your answer beforehand.
Connect your skills to the job description. Read the job description in detail before the interview and mention your skills that inline with it.
Focus on your positive experiences and skills. Your interviewer will ask followup questions based on them. This is your chance to give direction to the interview.
Make it a story. Dont make your answer sound mugged up. Make and pratice pointers in advance that you can talk about like a story in cronological oder during your interview.
The answer should sound more like a conversation. It should be flowy and not sound mugged up.





Hey, my name is <name>. I was born and brought up in <city>. After finishing my schooling I joined <college> to study <course>. 
Soon I was drawn to the Software Development industry considering the immense growth in it. 
I started upskilling myself and currently, I am comfortable with data structures and algorithms. 
I have become a 4 star on hacker rank and love solving programming problems. 
I have started learning web development and built a few projects in it.
I recently worked on building an MCQ test-taking application as one of the course assignments, I used my skills in javascript and REACT to make a good front end for the project.
I’ve always been skilled at working towards common goals with a team, during my college I worked on planning and organising various events like sports day, fests, etc.
I believe learning never stops and I aim to only grow and upskill myself in the future.
